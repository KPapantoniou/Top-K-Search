# Top-K Search
 This project implements algorithms for finding the top-K pairs with the highest sum of instance weight for pairs of the same age from demographic data sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/census-income/census-income.html). The goal is to compare the efficiency of two different algorithms using various parameters.
